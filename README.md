# Dynamic Out-of-Order Scheduling Simulator
## Project Overview
This project implements a dynamic out-of-order (OoO) scheduling simulator in Python. It's designed to model a 5-stage instruction pipeline and demonstrate the effects of conservative load-store ordering. The simulator provides insights into the efficiencies of core processor parameters.

## Features
* Dynamic Out-of-Order (OoO) scheduling simulation.
* Conservative load-store ordering for instruction handling.
* Support for a restricted set of simplified instructions (R, I, L, S types).
* Customizable issue widths and physical register counts.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
* Python (Version 2.7 or 3.x)
* GNU Make

### Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Python is correctly installed on your system.

### Running the Simulator
1. Place your instruction set file (e.g., test.in) in the project directory.
2. Use the Makefile to compile and run the simulation: 
make test\
This command processes the test.in file and generates the output in out.txt.

## Input Format
The input file (test.in) should contain:

* A first line with two comma-separated positive integers specifying the number of physical registers and the issue width of the machine.
* 1-256 lines of instructions in the format: 
- R,<REG>,<REG>,<REG> 
- I,<REG>,<REG>,<IMM> 
- L,<REG>,<IMM>,<REG> 
- S,<REG>,<IMM>,<REG>

## Output
The simulator outputs a file out.txt, detailing the scheduling sequence for each instruction with the stages <FE>,<DE>,<RE>,<DI>,<IS>,<WB>,<CO>.

## File Structure
**[scheduler.py](project.py)**: Main Python script for the OoO scheduling simulator.
**[Makefile](Makefile)**: Automates the build and execution process.
**[test.in](test.in)**: Sample input file containing the instruction set.
**test.out**: Output file generated by the makefile.
